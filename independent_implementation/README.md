Trying out to write some my own implementation from scratch.
Using LLMs reasoners to think through a way to approach this project.
Prompt:

> I want to try doing something locally to learn about alpha zero. I could write python code and use pyTorch. I want to have experience of creating a system that can play a game to superhuman levels. I don't have a GPU, just my CPU, but I could run it overnight.

> Could you guide me through the process of applying Alpha zero to a game that learns to become superhuman? I think this would be a valuable experience and give me skills in machine learning. I don't have too much time to spend, so I'd like the project to go smoothly.
